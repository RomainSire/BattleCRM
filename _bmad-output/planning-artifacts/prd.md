# Product Requirements Document - BattleCRM

**Author:** Romain
**Date:** 2026-01-28

## Executive Summary

**BattleCRM** is a data-driven CRM specifically designed for freelance consultants operating in "war machine hibernation" mode. Unlike traditional CRMs that are either too simplistic or overwhelming productivity killers, BattleCRM enables continuous improvement through simple, intuitive A/B testing with a modern, enjoyable interface.

The product addresses the unique freelance workflow: long periods in mission (hibernation mode) with minimal prospecting, followed by the need for rapid activation into "war mode" when a mission ends. The critical requirement is the ability to go from 0 to active prospecting in less than 24 hours, then find a new mission within 30-45 days.

**Primary User:** The user themselves (freelance developer prospecting to ESN firms), with controlled multi-account capability for a few freelance friends.

**Core Problem Solved:** Traditional CRM solutions fail freelancers in two ways: simple tools (Excel, Notion, Airtable) lack data-driven insights and don't measure the right KPIs, while enterprise CRMs are bloated productivity killers that cost more time than they save. Freelancers need something that delivers immediate ergonomic value while enabling scientific optimization of their approach.

### What Makes This Special

**The "Aha!" Moment:** Users realize they can continuously improve their prospecting approach through simple, intuitive A/B testing without fighting the tool. The modern, pleasant interface makes data entry faster than pen and paper, turning every interaction into actionable data for self-improvement.

**Counter-Intuitive Insight:** Most CRMs optimize for volume (sales teams, high-frequency transactions). BattleCRM optimizes for quality in a low-volume, high-stakes context (1-2 missions per year). It applies growth hacking principles to personal freelance activity - treating yourself as the product to optimize.

**Core Philosophy:** "A few highly significant KPIs > 50 KPIs measuring everything." Ruthless simplicity with scientific rigor. Every pixel must earn its place. Zero tolerance for friction.

**Differentiated Approach:**

1. **Performance Matrix (Variant × Funnel Stage)** - The central view that shows conversion rates for each CV/pitch variant at each funnel stage, with Bayesian updating to extract insights even from low sample sizes

2. **Independent Battles per Funnel Stage** - Each funnel stage has its own A/B test "Battle" that progresses independently based on its volume. When statistical significance is reached for a stage, declare a winner and start the next Battle (winner vs new challenger) - without resetting other stages. This addresses the volume asymmetry: early stages (CV sending) accumulate data fast, while late stages (interviews) take longer

3. **Cold Start Optimization** - LinkedIn CSV import to go from 0 to 50 prospects in under 2 hours. The tool must be ready to activate "war mode" within 24 hours

4. **Qualitative + Quantitative** - Lead scoring (🟢 hot / 🟡 neutral / 🔴 cold) complements quantitative metrics, because gut feeling is also data

5. **Customizable Funnel** - Workflow evolves with experience. Funnel stages are configurable without touching code (max 15 stages, linear order, no overcomplexity)

**Vision If Wildly Successful:** Freelancers continuously improve based on real market signals. Mission flow becomes completely controllable and actionable on demand. Emotions are replaced with cold, data-driven perspective. The tool is efficient enough that prospecting continues even during missions, enabling business development opportunities. The freelancer becomes a self-optimizing system.

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** web_app (Web Application)
**Domain:** general (productivity/personal CRM tool)
**Complexity:** low (no heavy regulatory compliance)
**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Backend:** Adonis.js
- **Database:** Supabase (built-in auth + Row Level Security + delegated backup/infrastructure)
- **Hosting:** Self-hosted VPS
- **Authentication:** Email/Password via Supabase with `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` environment variable control
- **Repository Structure:** Simple monorepo with front app, back app, and shared schemas/types/DTOs

**Core Data Model:**
- **3 Primary Tables:** Prospects (people), Interactions (timeline), Positionings (A/B test variants)
- **Customizable Funnel:** 10 default stages (Lead qualified → First contact → Connection established → Positive response → ESN qualification → Application sent → ESN interview(s) → Final client interview(s) → Proposal received → Contract signed ✅)
- **Multi-user:** Data isolation via user_id from day one

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- **Ruthless Ergonomics:** 3-click maximum rule. Minimalist aggression (every pixel earns its place). Zero friction (pre-filled fields, permissive validation, no popups except destructive actions)
- **Code Quality Non-Negotiable:** Zero tolerance for data bugs (guaranteed rage quit). Automated tests on critical operations. Data integrity first (soft delete, transactions, rigorous validation)
- **Cold Start Optimized:** 0 → war mode in < 24h. CSV import as day-1 priority feature. 0 → 50 prospects in < 2h
- **Standalone Value:** App viable without external dependencies (LinkedIn/Waalaxy). Integrations are nice-to-have bonuses. Core value = CRM + Analytics + A/B testing

**Innovation Signals:**
- Bayesian updating for low-volume contexts
- Independent Battles per funnel stage for A/B testing (volume-aware progression)
- Hybrid qualitative + quantitative lead scoring
- "War machine hibernation" mental model

### Why Independent Battles (Not Global Sprints)

**The Problem with Global Sprints:**
A global sprint (e.g., "test CV v1 vs v2 for 2 weeks across all stages") fails because of volume asymmetry:
- Early funnel stages (CV sending) accumulate 50+ data points in 2 weeks
- Late funnel stages (interviews) may only have 5 data points in the same period
- A global reset would waste accumulated learning on high-volume stages while low-volume stages learned nothing

**The Battle Solution:**
Each funnel stage runs its own independent "Battle" (A vs B test):
- **Envoi CV: Battle #4** (CV v3 vs v4) - already on 4th iteration due to high volume
- **Relance: Battle #2** (Msg v1 vs v2) - progressing at its own pace
- **Entretien: Battle #1** (Pitch v1 vs v2) - still on first test due to low volume

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Volume-Adaptive:** Each stage progresses at its natural pace
2. **No Wasted Learning:** Closing a Battle on one stage doesn't reset others
3. **Continuous Optimization:** High-volume stages iterate faster, providing quicker wins
4. **Statistical Integrity:** Each Battle reaches significance before declaring a winner

## Success Criteria

### User Success

**Primary Success Moment:** User realizes they can continuously improve their prospecting approach through simple, intuitive A/B testing with an interface that makes data entry faster than pen and paper. Every interaction becomes actionable data for self-improvement.

**Immediate Success Indicators (First Battles - 2-4 weeks):**
- Identify which positioning variant (CV, pitch, message) performs best based on real conversion data for at least one funnel stage
- See measurable improvement in conversion rates as Battles conclude
- Successfully complete at least one Battle cycle (declare winner, start next Battle with winner vs new challenger)

**Conversion Improvement Targets:**
- **+10% conversion rate improvement** on any variant = significant success
- Critical challenge: System must help determine when there's enough data for results to be statistically significant vs. just noise (Bayesian updating addresses this)

**Cold Start Success (War Mode Activation):**
- Go from 0 to 50 prospects imported in under 2 hours
- Activate "war mode" in less than 24 hours from mission end
- Performance Matrix shows actionable insights with as few as 10 prospects

**Adoption Success Threshold:**
- If no perceived value after 1 week of use → adoption failure
- Logging an interaction must take maximum 3 clicks and under 1 minute
- Tool must be observably faster than "writing it down on paper"

**Long-term User Success Vision:**
- Achieve 10 interviews per week in active war mode
- Sign new mission contract within 30 days of entering war mode
- Demonstrate continuous improvement each week through measurable conversion rate increases
- Maintain cold, data-driven perspective replacing emotional decision-making
- Enable prospecting continuation even during active missions (business development)

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Romain - Le Réveil de la Machine de Guerre

Romain est en mission longue depuis 18 mois chez un grand compte. Il apprécie la stabilité mais sait que rien ne dure éternellement. Un vendredi soir, son manager lui annonce que le projet se termine dans 45 jours. Le lundi matin, au lieu de paniquer, Romain ouvre BattleCRM qu'il a préparé pendant ses soirées tranquilles.

En moins de 2 heures, il importe 50 prospects depuis son export LinkedIn Sales Navigator. Le système détecte automatiquement 5 doublons qu'il avait déjà ajoutés manuellement le mois dernier, lui propose des mises à jour qu'il valide en 3 clics. Il assigne rapidement ses 3 variantes de CV (v1, v2 optimisé React, v3 focus architecture) et ses 2 templates de messages LinkedIn qu'il avait préparés en mode hibernation.

Le breakthrough survient après 10 jours. La Battle "Envoi CV" atteint la significativité statistique : CV v2 converti à 52% au passage "Lead qualifié → Premier contact" contre 38% pour CV v1. Le feu tricolore passe au vert 🟢. Romain clôture la Battle et lance la suivante : CV v2 (le gagnant) contre CV v3. Pendant ce temps, la Battle "Message Relance" continue indépendamment à son propre rythme - elle n'a pas encore assez de volume. Les données sont claires, froides, sans émotion : il sait exactement quelle approche marche, étape par étape.

25 jours après avoir activé le mode guerre, Romain signe une nouvelle mission avec un TJM 15% plus élevé. Quand son ami freelance lui demande "comment tu as fait ?", sa réponse est simple : "J'ai traité ma prospection comme un produit à optimiser. Chaque semaine j'étais meilleur que la précédente. Les chiffres ne mentent pas."

**Capacités révélées :**
- Cold Start rapide (Import CSV + activation < 24h)
- Performance Matrix avec Bayesian updating
- Battles indépendantes par étape de funnel (A/B testing adapté au volume)
- Gestion positionnements multiples
- Dashboard conversion temps réel

### Journey 2: Romain - L'Hibernation Productive

Romain est en pleine mission, concentré sur son code. Mais tous les premiers dimanches du mois, il se réserve 2 heures pour "rester prêt". Ce dimanche, il ouvre BattleCRM et met à jour son CV avec les nouvelles technos qu'il maîtrise maintenant. Il crée une variante v4 qui met en avant son expérience récente en architecture microservices.

Il parcourt LinkedIn de manière détendue, trouve 15 nouveaux chargés d'affaires ESN intéressants, exporte le CSV, l'importe dans BattleCRM. Aucun stress, aucune friction. Il ajoute aussi un nouveau template de message LinkedIn qui met l'accent sur son expertise cloud récemment acquise.

Trois mois plus tard, quand son contrat se termine brusquement (le client coupe le budget), Romain n'a qu'à activer le mode guerre. Tout est déjà là : 80 prospects qualifiés, 4 variantes de CV testables, 3 templates de messages. Il n'a perdu aucune des 2 heures mensuelles d'investissement - c'était sa police d'assurance.

**Capacités révélées :**
- Mode hibernation utile (pas juste un gimmick)
- Préparation progressive sans pression
- Import prospects par petits lots
- Gestion variantes de positionnement
- Archive searchable (prospects anciens restent accessibles)

### Journey 3: Thomas - L'Ami Freelance Sceptique Devenu Converti

Thomas est développeur freelance et ami de Romain. Il prospecte "à l'ancienne" : un Google Sheet avec 30 prospects, des notes éparses dans Notion, ses CV dans un dossier Dropbox. Quand sa mission se termine, il panique toujours un peu et envoie le même CV à tout le monde.

Romain lui montre BattleCRM un soir : "Regarde, j'ai testé 3 CV différents. Celui-ci converti 20% mieux. J'ai les chiffres." Thomas est intrigué mais sceptique. Romain lui crée un compte (variable `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true` activée temporairement). "Teste pendant un mois, tes données sont 100% isolées des miennes."

Thomas commence doucement. Import de 20 prospects, 2 variantes de CV. Les deux premières semaines, il trouve l'interface agréable mais pas révolutionnaire. La troisième semaine, la Performance Matrix commence à montrer des patterns : son CV "senior" performe mieux avec les grandes ESN, son CV "expert technique" marche mieux avec les ESN mid-size.

Le déclic arrive quand sa première Battle atteint la significativité : il teste son CV gagnant contre une nouvelle variante qui met plus en avant son expérience DevOps. En 10 jours il a sa réponse : +15% de conversion. Thomas réalise qu'il peut **apprendre de ses propres données**. Six semaines après avoir commencé, il a signé une mission et envoie un message à Romain : "Tu avais raison. Je ne retournerai jamais à mon Google Sheet."

**Capacités révélées :**
- Onboarding simple pour nouvel utilisateur
- Data isolation totale (confidentialité)
- Courbe d'apprentissage douce
- Value visible rapidement (3 semaines)
- Interface intuitive sans formation

### Journey 4: Romain - L'Administrateur Technique (Edge Case: Gestion Multi-User)

Romain vient de terminer le MVP de BattleCRM. Deux de ses amis freelances lui demandent d'essayer l'outil. Il se connecte en SSH sur son VPS, édite le fichier `.env` : `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true`. Il envoie l'URL à Thomas et Julie avec un message : "Créez vos comptes, vous avez 48h. Après je referme les inscriptions."

Thomas et Julie créent leurs comptes via l'interface standard email/password. Romain vérifie dans Supabase que le Row Level Security fonctionne correctement : chaque utilisateur ne voit que ses propres données. Il fait un test rapide : se connecte avec le compte de test, essaie d'accéder à l'API avec un autre user_id → accès refusé. Parfait.

Une semaine plus tard, Thomas signale un bug étrange : "Mes doublons ne sont pas bien détectés lors de l'import CSV." Romain se connecte à son propre compte (pas celui de Thomas - il ne peut pas accéder aux données de Thomas), reproduit le bug avec ses propres données, identifie le problème dans le code, déploie un fix en 30 minutes.

Deux mois après le lancement, Romain décide de fermer temporairement les inscriptions. Il édite `.env`: `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false`, redémarre le backend. Sur la page de login, le bouton "Créer un compte" disparaît. Simple, efficace, contrôle total.

**Capacités révélées :**
- Gestion simple variable environnement
- Monitoring basique mais efficace
- Row Level Security vérifié
- Debug sans accès aux données users
- Déploiement et maintenance VPS

## Web Application Specific Requirements

### Project-Type Overview

BattleCRM is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using React + Vite for the frontend and Adonis.js for the backend. The architecture prioritizes modern web standards, developer ergonomics, and portfolio-quality code over broad compatibility with legacy systems.

**Target Audience:** Developers and technical freelancers with modern browsers and devices.

### Technical Architecture Considerations

**Architecture Pattern:** SPA with RESTful Backend
- **Frontend:** React 18+ with Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for component library
- **Backend:** Adonis.js providing RESTful API endpoints
- **Communication:** Standard REST API calls (no WebSockets/real-time requirements)
- **State Management:** TBD based on complexity (Context API, Zustand, or Redux if needed)
- **Routing:** Client-side routing (React Router or similar)
- **Language:** Full TypeScript strict mode (front + back)

**Monorepo Structure:**
- **Package Manager:** pnpm (fast, efficient, disk-space optimized)
- **Workspace Management:** pnpm workspaces (turborepo if needed, but likely overkill)
- `/apps/frontend` - React + Vite SPA
- `/apps/backend` - Adonis.js REST API
- `/packages/shared` - Shared TypeScript types, schemas, DTOs

**TypeScript Configuration:**
- Strict mode enabled across all packages
- Shared tsconfig.base.json for consistency
- Type-safe API contracts via shared DTOs

### Browser Matrix & Compatibility

**Supported Browsers:**
- **Chrome:** Latest 2 versions (primary development target)
- **Firefox:** Latest 2 versions (secondary target)
- **No legacy browser support** - IE11, old Safari versions explicitly excluded

**Rationale:** Target audience is developers who maintain up-to-date browsers. Eliminating legacy support enables modern JavaScript features, cleaner code, and faster development.

**Testing Strategy:**
- Primary development in Chrome
- Regular manual testing in Firefox
- Automated tests run in headless Chrome

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Device Support:**
- **Desktop:** Primary experience (1920x1080, 1440x900, 1366x768)
- **Mobile:** Responsive support (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- **Tablet:** Responsive support as byproduct of desktop/mobile design

**Design Philosophy:**
- Desktop-first design (primary use case is desk work during prospecting)
- Mobile-friendly for on-the-go consultation (checking stats, quick logging)
- No separate mobile app needed - responsive web suffices

**Styling Approach:**
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first for rapid development and consistent design
- **shadcn/ui:** Pre-built accessible components (buttons, dialogs, forms, tables)
- **Design Tokens:** Tailwind config for colors, spacing, typography
- **Dark Mode:** Support via Tailwind (nice-to-have, not MVP blocker)

**Breakpoints:**
- Desktop: 1024px+
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Mobile: < 768px

### Performance Targets

**Load Performance:**
- Initial page load: < 2 seconds on 4G connection
- Subsequent navigation: < 500ms (SPA instant transitions)
- CSV import (50 prospects): < 5 minutes (server processing time)

**Runtime Performance:**
- Page interactions: < 100ms response time
- List rendering (100 prospects): < 1 second
- Performance Matrix calculation: < 2 seconds

**Bundle Size:**
- Initial JS bundle: Target < 300KB gzipped
- Code splitting for routes not immediately needed
- Lazy loading for heavy components (charts, Performance Matrix)
- Tailwind purging unused styles in production

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Vite for optimized builds and tree-shaking
- React.memo / useMemo for expensive computations
- Virtual scrolling if lists exceed 100 items
- Debounced search/filter inputs

### SEO Strategy

**SEO Status:** Not required

**Rationale:** BattleCRM is a private, authenticated application. No public pages need indexing. All content is behind authentication wall.

**Public Pages (if any):**
- Login page (no SEO value needed)
- Optional: Landing page explaining the tool (future, low priority)

**Meta Tags:** Minimal - just title and viewport for proper rendering.

### Accessibility Level

**Target Level:** WCAG 2.1 Level A (with selective AA features)

**Rationale:** Portfolio showcase quality - code must demonstrate accessibility awareness without over-engineering for a personal tool.

**Required Accessibility Features:**

*Keyboard Navigation:*
- All interactive elements accessible via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Logical tab order matching visual flow
- Focus indicators visible and clear
- Skip navigation links where appropriate

*Visual Accessibility:*
- Color contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA minimums (4.5:1 for text)
- No reliance on color alone for information (use icons + colors)
- Readable fonts with adequate sizing (minimum 16px body text)

*Semantic HTML:*
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Semantic elements (nav, main, article, section)
- Form labels properly associated with inputs
- ARIA attributes where semantic HTML insufficient

*Screen Reader Support:*
- Meaningful alt text for images
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons
- ARIA live regions for dynamic updates (e.g., "Prospect added successfully")
- Proper form validation feedback

**shadcn/ui Advantage:** Components built with accessibility in mind (ARIA patterns, keyboard support), reducing manual accessibility work.

**Not Required (Out of Scope for MVP):**
- Full WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance
- Screen magnification optimization
- Advanced assistive technology testing
- ARIA-heavy complex widget patterns

**Testing Approach:**
- Keyboard-only navigation testing during development
- Automated accessibility tests (axe-core, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)
- Manual contrast checking with browser dev tools
- Occasional screen reader spot-checking (nice-to-have, not systematic)

### Implementation Considerations

**Development Workflow:**
- Hot module replacement (HMR) via Vite for fast iteration
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety across frontend and backend
- Shared types/DTOs prevent API contract mismatches
- ESLint + Prettier for code consistency
- pnpm for fast, efficient dependency management

**Deployment Strategy:**
- **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose
- **Frontend Container:** Node-based build → nginx serving static files
- **Backend Container:** Node runtime with Adonis.js application
- **Reverse Proxy:** nginx container routing /api/* to backend
- **Database:** Supabase (external managed service, not containerized)

**Docker Compose Structure:**
```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    - Vite production build
    - Nginx serving static files
    - Port 80/443 exposed

  backend:
    - Adonis.js app
    - Port 3333 internal
    - Environment variables for config

  nginx-proxy:
    - Routes / to frontend
    - Routes /api/* to backend
    - SSL termination (Let's Encrypt)
```

**Benefits of Docker Approach:**
- Consistent environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Easy deployment and rollback
- Isolated dependencies
- Simplified VPS setup
- Professional deployment practice (portfolio showcase)

**Browser API Usage:**
- LocalStorage for client-side preferences (theme, UI state)
- Fetch API for REST calls (no axios dependency needed)
- File API for CSV import handling
- No service workers (offline mode not required)

**Security Considerations:**
- HTTPS enforced
- CSRF protection via Supabase/backend
- XSS prevention via React's default escaping
- Content Security Policy headers
- Environment variables for secrets (never committed)

## Project Scoping & Phased Development

### MVP Strategy & Philosophy

**MVP Approach:** Problem-Solving MVP avec Cold Start Optimization

**Philosophy:** Résoudre le problème core du freelance qui doit activer son "mode guerre" en moins de 24h, avec capacité d'A/B testing via Battles indépendantes par étape de funnel. L'MVP doit être suffisamment ergonomique pour battre Excel/Notion dès la première semaine d'utilisation, sinon échec d'adoption.

**Strategic Rationale:**

- **Fallback:** Display raw conversion % with sample size warning if Bayesian too complex

*Risk 2: Performance Matrix Calculation Performance*
- **Mitigation:** Backend caching, incremental calculations
- **Fallback:** Calculate on-demand with loading indicator if real-time too slow

*Risk 3: CSV Import Edge Cases*
- **Mitigation:** Extensive validation, clear error messages, manual override options
- **Fallback:** Manual prospect entry if CSV import fails

**Market Risks:**

*Risk 1: Tool Trop Complexe (Adoption Failure)*
- **Validation:** Onboarding flow testing, première semaine usage tracking
- **Mitigation:** Ruthless simplification if adoption < 1 week threshold
- **Metric:** If no perceived value after 1 week → pivot UX immediately

*Risk 2: A/B Testing Pas Assez de Volume*
- **Validation:** Test Bayesian avec 10-20 prospects simulés
- **Mitigation:** Traffic light reliability warnings, qualitative lead scoring backup
- **Metric:** Si insights pas actionnables avec 20 prospects → revoir approche stats

**Resource Risks:**

*Risk 1: MVP Prend Plus Que 9 Semaines*
- **Contingency:** Scope reduction - retirer features 9 et 10 (Archive, Independent Battles)
- **Absolute Minimum:** Features 1-8 suffisent pour validation

*Risk 2: Bugs Data Compromettent Adoption*
- **Prevention:** TDD sur opérations critiques, transactions partout, soft delete
- **Response:** Fix immédiat < 24h si data bug identifié (zero tolerance policy)
