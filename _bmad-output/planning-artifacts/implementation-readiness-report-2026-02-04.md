And I am redirected to the dashboard (FR51)
```

### Dependency Analysis

### Quality Violations Found

#### 🔴 Critical Violations
**None identified.**

#### 🟠 Major Issues
**None identified.**

#### 🟡 Minor Concerns

| Issue | Location | Severity | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Technical setup stories | Epic 1: Stories 1.1-1.4, 1.8 | Minor | Acceptable for greenfield - foundation pattern is industry standard |
| Epic 1 naming | "Project Foundation & Authentication" | Minor | Consider renaming to "User Access & Foundation" for clarity |

### Greenfield Project Verification

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Initial project setup story (1.1) | ✅ Present |
| Development environment config (1.8) | ✅ Docker setup included |
| Starter template approach | ✅ Composed setup per Architecture |
| CI/CD pipeline setup | ⚠️ Not explicitly in MVP stories (acceptable - can be added post-MVP) |

### Epic Quality Assessment Summary

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| User Value Focus | 6/7 epics pure value | Epic 1 justified foundation |
| Epic Independence | 7/7 | No forward dependencies |
| Story Structure | 42/42 | All properly formatted |
| Acceptance Criteria | 42/42 | All BDD format, testable |
| Dependency Compliance | 100% | No violations |
